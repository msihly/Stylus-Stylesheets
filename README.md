# Stylus Stylesheets
## *A collection of stylesheets to be used with the Stylus extension for Chrome*

### **These stylesheets are not maintained, optimized, or fully functional**

### Due to the nature of constant change on major websites, these styles will break often and require manual updating. Additionally, the use of webpack and similar utilities causes CSS files to use randomized selector names making it difficult or impossible to replace styles instead of simply adding onto them; several sections will contain massive blocks of selectors that have no effect, but cannot be identified for removal.
